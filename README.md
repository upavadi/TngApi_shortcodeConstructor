## Introduction
__TNG Shortcode Constructor__ is a stripped down version of The [TngApi V3.3](https://github.com/upavadi/TngApi/archive/refs/tags/V3.3.2.zip) plugin for Wordpress. 

[TngApi V3.3](https://github.com/upavadi/TngApi/archive/refs/tags/V3.3.2.zip), a stand-alone plugin, was published in 2015. It integrates smoothly with [TNG (The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding)](http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/) to display genealogy data in Wordpress pages. 
It's main attraction was the ability of the user to add / amend family data and ability of the administrator to perform one-click transfer of this data to tng database. With changes to MySQL and TNG database structure, I have found it virtually imposible to support this feature.

I understand that, now, a TNG mod, the [Family Group Worksheet ](https://tng.lythgoes.net/wiki/index.php/Family_Group_Worksheet), has the facility for administrators to merge data in to TNG database.

Plan is to have the __TNG Shortcode Constructor__ do everything the TngApi did, except update TNG data.
- It implements Privacy Credentials in the TNG General SetUp>Privacy
  - Require Login:
  - Show Living Data:
  - Show Names for Living:
  - Show Names for Private:
  - I may implement the following in the next update
    - Show LDS Data: Current shortcodes do not show LDS data, as do not have LDS data my database.
    - Restrict access to assigned tree. As I only have one tree, I have not implemented this. Perhaps on next version.

 - It implements Privacy Credentials for the User
    - Allow User to view information for living individuals
    - Allow User to view information for private individuals
  - I may implement the following in the next update
      - Allow User to view LDS information
      - Restrict User access to specific trees and branches.

# Change Log
- __Current & Released version is 1.04__
  - Added Legacy Widget, `TngWp_search` which searches names in TNG database.
    - The widget requires a Wordpress page to display search results.
    - Page Name, "TNG Name Search", which is same as Widget name, is defined in /widget/TngSearch.php
    - The widget obeys credentials setup in TNG admin.
    - To create the Wordpress page, navigate to Settings>TNG Shortcodes and enter a page name (slug) such as tng-search. __Do not leave blanks__ 
        - A Wordpress page will be created, with shortcode as content, when changes are saved.
        - Do not leave space between words such as "tng search"
        - Avoid using __"search"__ as page name as this may clash with the widget in TngApi.
    - Widget will only be activate if a Wordpress page for the widget is created and page name is shown in the Plugin Paths.
    - Note: I use [a Wordpress Classic Widget Plugin](https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/) to work in the Widget area. Makes it very easy to work with Legacy Widgets.<br/><br/> 

  - Added shortcode, `TngWp_RandomMedia` which is set to display 
    - Default images of deceased
    - images set to "AlwaysOn" 
    - headstones
    - For Documents, default image, /img/doc01.jpg, is shown, with description and link of the document. 
    - This is added subsequent to user request and it may be modified to suit user needs.  
    - Display of Document is fluid and I am open to suggestions.<br/><br/>    
  
  - Added shortcode, `TngWp_RandomPhoto` which is set to display images of deceased OR images set to be 'always on'. 
    - current condition is set to display default images of deseased OR images marked as 'Always On' 
    - This is added susequent to user request and it may be modified to suit user needs.  
    - Functionality may change depending on comments / suggestions from users<br/><br/>    

  - Added shortcode `TngWp_manniversariesDeceased` which Calculates years between marriage and first death.
    - This shortcode adds extra column to `TngWp_manniversaries`, with header title “Years - First Death”. This displays years between marriage date and first death. Feel free to suggest changes in header titles. For test purposes, this column will display “Living” if both spouses are living.<br/><br/>

- 1.02
  - Special characters (eg Norwegian Æ, Ø, Å ) from TNG database showing up as ? or similar. A charset to UTF applied to all TNG tables in 'shortcodeContent.php' 
- 1.01
  -Incorrect file name /TngWp/shortcodes/gone.php. Changed to /TngWp/shortcodes/Gone.php.
  - Omitted to add /templates in gone.html.php. Fixed
  - Undeclared variable when using PHP 8.01 in /templates in gone.html.php Fixed
- Released Version 1.0

# Other Shortcodes

- `TngWp_danniversaries` List death anniversaries for the selected month.
- `TngWp_gone` (Gone But Not Forgotten). Gives birth dates and death dates for yesterday, today and tomorrow. It is encapsulated in a DIV and it may be possible to include that in your content. ( I have used similar in [my Home Page](http://www.upavadi.net/))

- `TngWp_submitImage` Upload images from Wordpress. Image will be stored in a TNG Media Collection specified by you.

# Add Your Own Shortcode
 - Create a file for your page. (e.g. myShortcode.html.php)
 - Create a file with the class for the shortcode (e.g. myShortcode.php)
   
        class TngWp_Shortcode_MyShortcode extends TngWp_Shortcode_AbstractShortcode
         {
          const SHORTCODE = 'TngWp_MyShortcode'; //This is your shortcode name
          
           public function show()
          {
            // This may best place to define general variables.
            //Array $conext will be available in your page.
            $context = array(        
            );
           //This html file will show your page
           return $this->templates->render('myshortcode.html', $context);
          }
        }
  
 - Add Short code class in the plugin file tng-shortode-constructop.php

        $content->addShortcode(new TngWp_Shortcode_MyShortcode());
    
- Hopefully, that Should work
