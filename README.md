## Introduction
__TNG Shortcode Constructor__ is a stripped down version of The [TngApi V3.3.2](https://github.com/upavadi/TngApi/archive/refs/tags/V3.3.2.zip) plugin for Wordpress. 

[TngApi V3.3.2](https://github.com/upavadi/TngApi/archive/refs/tags/V3.3.2.zip), a stand-alone plugin, was published in 2015. It integrates smoothly with TNG ( The Next Generation of Genealogy Sitebuilding ) to display genealogy data in Wordpress pages. 
It's main attraction was the ability of the user to add / amend family data and ability of the administrator to perform one-click transfer of this data to tng database. With changes to MySQL and TNG database structure I have found it virtually imposible to support this feature.

I understand that now, a TNG mod, the [Family Group Worksheet ](https://tng.lythgoes.net/wiki/index.php/Family_Group_Worksheet),has the facility for administrators to merge data in to TNG database.

Plan is to have the __TNG Shortcode Constructor__ do everything the TngApi did, except update TNG data.
- It implements Privacy Credentials in the General SetUp>Privacy
  - Require Login:
  - Show Living Data:
  - Show Names for Private:
  - I may implement the following in the next update
    - Show LDS Data: Current shortcodes do not show LDS data, as do not have LDS data.
    - Restrict access to assigned tree. As I only have one tree, I have not implemented this. Perhaps on next version.

 - It implements Privacy Credentials for the User
    - Allow to view information for living individuals
    - Allow to view information for private individuals
    - I may implement the following in the next update
      - Allow to view LDS information
      - Restrict access to specific trees and branches.
